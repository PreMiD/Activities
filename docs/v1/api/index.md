# API Reference

This section provides detailed documentation for the PreMiD Activity Development API. It covers all the classes, interfaces, and functions available for creating activities.

## Overview

The PreMiD API consists of several key components:

- [Presence Class](/api/presence-class): The main class for creating activities
- [PresenceData Interface](/api/presence-data): The interface for defining what data to show in Discord
- [Metadata Interface](/api/metadata): The interface for defining activity metadata
- [Slideshow Class](/api/slideshow): A class for creating slideshows that alternate between different presence data
- [iFrame Class](/api/iframe): A class for interacting with iframes
- [Utility Functions](/api/utility-functions): Helper functions for common tasks

## Getting Started

If you're new to PreMiD Activity Development, we recommend starting with the [Guide](/guide/) section, which provides step-by-step instructions for creating your first activity.

## Type Definitions

The API is fully typed with TypeScript, and the type definitions are available in the `@types/premid` package. You can find the source code for the type definitions in the [Activities repository](https://github.com/PreMiD/Activities/tree/main/%40types/premid).

## Examples
