### Setup
* Clone the PreMiD repository to your system.
### Using the script
* Open up a terminal and run `yarn translator`
* When prompted, select the **Language Code** for the language you are translated (e.g `ga_IE` for Irish)
* Once selected. The script will first cache all presences metadata files, it will then go through each one and remove the files containing the language you inputted from the cache.
* You will then be prompted to enter the translation for each presence one by one, in alphabetical order.
* To stop at any time, hit `ctrl+c`
